## Overview :
Road accidents have become very common nowadays. With ever increasing number of vehicles on the roads the, the incidences of road accidents seem to be increasing 
day by day. But is it really true ? Have the modern safety standards along with new laws resulted in a decrease in the road accidents ? Where do most accidents occur ?
What fraction of accidents are severe ? In this Exploratory Data Analysis project, we try to answer such questions by analysing the dataset to arrive at various 
conclusions. The dataset we are working on was gathered by the UK government from the traffic data between 2005 and 2016, recording over 1.5 million accidents 
in the process, making this one of the most comprehensive traffic data sets. <br>

The complete step by step process is presented in the following notebook :

Below are some of the findings from the analysis <br><br>


## Conclusions from the Analysis :

### Distribution of Accidents : 

The accident density, as expected seem to be scattered non- uniformly with certain regions with higher density (brighter areas in the map). 
The points also seem to represent the network of roads throughout UK ! Most of the accidents seem to be packed in and around the major cities in UK. 
Also. a majority of the accidents seem to have occured in the sounthern part of the island, as the northern part is dimly lit with respect to the accident 
density.
